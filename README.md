## 🔍 Summary

This repository contains code, data, and results for analyzing clonal and genomic heterogeneity in metastatic bladder cancer. We integrate multi-tumors whole-genome sequencing and cell-free DNA to reconstruct subclonal architectures and infer patterns of tumor evolution across primary and metastatic sites.
